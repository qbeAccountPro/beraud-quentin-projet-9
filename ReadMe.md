**Green Code** : 
The stakes of green code involve optimizing software to minimize energy consumption and resource usage, reducing environmental impact.

In the pursuit of optimizing software for reduced environmental impact, two online tools prove valuable: Ecoindex and Ecometer. While Ecoindex measures ecological impact, Ecometer helps identify initial strategies to mitigate it. These tools  offering insights into resource usage and guiding coder actions towards greener coding practices

Three levers contribute to lightening the ecological footprint of a website: functional frugality, container optimization, and content optimization. The approach starts with the current state of the applicationand involves implementing a series of actions to reduce the website's ecological footprint, followed by evaluating the achieved gains compared to the initial situation.
